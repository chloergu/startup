I learned that you have to do six things to make changes: save your code, view source control in VS Code, click on the plus under the changes drop-down, type in a message describing the change, press the checkmark to commit, then sync the changes.

"Sync changes" means to push and pull commits from and to origin/main.

A merge conflict is where you make and commit changes in two different places in the same spot, and don't sync them until you've changed both. You can enter the merge conflict editor in VS Code to fix this.

You can edit a video or image file size with width=300 or any other number.

To embed with HTML from YouTube, you need to go to share and then embed.

I have added both the html and css versions of simon to my startup website.
