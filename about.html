        <h2>About TripSplit</h2>
        TripSplit is a group budgeting app designed to make paying your friends easier when needing to split a multitude of costs. 
        All you need to do is create an account, then join or create a group with a unique name. I decided to make this web application
        when I ran into quite a few disputes about money when going on a trip with a few friends. If we had used TripSplit, it would have cleared
        up a lot more about money and enabled clearer communication.
        <h2>About me</h2>
        My name is Chloe Guerrero, and I am a computer science student with a physics minor. I'm also silver certified in ballroom and social dance.
        I also have a cat named Greyson who is my world. When I became a CS major I immediately knew that it was for me, and I'm very excited to see what 
        more I accomplish in this field.<br>
