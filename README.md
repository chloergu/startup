BYU CS260 Web Programming Project.

My project will be a group budgeting website. Ever gone on a trip with friends, and had to deal with the hassle of splitting money for the trip evenly? Look no more. In my website, you will be able to create a password for your group, and log in with your own account so you can come back later. Insert all the expenses you will come across, and it will evenly split all the expenses between your group. One person only there for part of the trip? No problem. Individuals can check and uncheck expenses that they didn't participate in/use, and it will remove that from their total. You've paid already for an expense? Easy peasy, there's an option to check that so you can get reimbursed. The end goal is to partner with the payment services venmo/zelle/paypal to make paying even easier.
